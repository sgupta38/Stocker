> ### Observer-Notifier Demo

This application demonstrates how observer-notifier can be implemented using [**Web Scraping**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping)

Here, for the sake of demo, I am observing the value of *'Games Current In Play'* on [Virtual Stock Exchange](https://www.marketwatch.com/game) website.
You can just type any value greater than the displayed value. If counter reaches that value, a notification will pop-up on your window.

This can be used in various real time applications such as stock monitoring and various utilities.
